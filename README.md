# Homework #3

In Homework #3 we will write come OpenMP code to numerically evaluate integrals
using various integration algorithms.

**Repository layout:** note that there are some slight changes from Homework #2.

* `homework3/`:

  Python wrapper of your C library. The functions defined here allow you to use
  your C code from within Python. The test suite calls these functions which, in
  turn, call your C functions. **DO NOT MODIFY**. Any modifications will be
  ignored / overwritten when the homework is submitted.
  
  Please read the docstrings in this file to see how to call the wrapper and
  what kind of information is expected to be returned. Compare with the
  signature of the underlying C function.

* `include/`:

  The library headers containing (1) the C function prototypes and (2) the C
  function documentation. Document your C functions here.
  
* `lib/`:

  The compiled C code will be placed here as a shared object library named
  `libhomework3.so`.
  
* `report/`:

  Place your `report.pdf` here. See the *"Report"* section below.

* `src/`:

  C library source files. This is where you will provide the bodies of the
  corresponding functions requested below.
  
  *Do not change the way in which these functions are called.* Doing so will
  break the Python wrappers located in `homework3/wrappers.py`. You may,
  however, write as many helper functions as you need.
  
  Aside from writing your own tests and performing computations for your report,
  everything you need to write for this homework will be put in the files here.
  
* `ctests/`:

  Directory in which to place any optional C code used to debug and test your
  library as well as practice compiling and linking C code. See the file
  `ctests/example.c` for more information and on how to compile.
    
* `Makefile`: See *"Compiling and Testing"* below.

* `test_homework3.py`: A sample test suite for your own testing purposes.

## Compiling and Testing

The makefile for this homework assignment has been provided for you. It will
compile the source code located in `src/` and create a shared object library
`lib/libhomework3.so`. **You can also use this Makefile to compile all of the
scripts you write in the directory, `ctests`.**

Run,

```
$ make lib
```

to create `lib/libhomework3.so`. This library must exist in order for the Python
wrappers to work. As a shortcut, running

```
$ make test
```

will perform

```
$ make lib
$ python test_homework3.py
```

Run,

```
$ make example.out
```

to compile the script `ctests/example.c` into an executable called
`example.out`. Copy the syntax of the corresponding make command if you would
like to write more C scripts.


## Assignment

In this assignment we will implement several numerical integration techniques in
serial and in parallel. Given a function, f, and some x-data points, form the
arrays

```
    x = [x_0, x_1, ..., x_{N-1}]
fvals = [f(x_0), f(x_1), ..., f(x_{N-1})]
```

Using these data one can approximate the integral of f from `x_0` to `x_{N-1}`
using the following formulae

* [Trapezoidal Rule](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/TrapezoidalRule.html)

  ![trapezoidal](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uwhpsc-2016/homework3/master/report/trapezoidal.png)
  
* [Simpson's Rule](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/SimpsonsRule.html)

  ![simpson](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uwhpsc-2016/homework3/master/report/simpson.png)

Scipy has built-in functions
[`scipy.linalg.trapz`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.integrate.trapz.html#scipy.integrate.trapz)
and
[`scipy.linalg.simps`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.integrate.simps.html#scipy.integrate.simps)
which, given an x-data set and function evaluations, will use these rules to
estimate the integral. For example,

``` python
>>> from numpy import linspace, sin, pi
>>> from scipy.integrate import trapz, simps
>>> x = linspace(-1,pi,8)  # eight, equally-spaced points between -1 and pi
>>> fvals = sin(x)
>>> integral_trapz = trapz(fvals, x)
>>> integral_simps = simps(fvals, x, even='first')  # see simps documentation
```

In this assignment we will write serial and parallel versions of these
algorithms. Additionally, we will perform some parameter tuning on our parallel
implementation of Simpson's rule. In particular, *you are to provide the
definitons of the below functions*.

### Implement These Functions:

Implement the functions declared in `include/integrate.h` and defined in
`src/integrate.c`. In each of these functions, `fvals` is a length `N` array of
function evaluations of type `double` on the elements of `x`, a length `N` array
of domain points of type `double`. These are fed in from either Python via Numpy
arrays or your test scripts in the directory `ctests`.

* `double trapz_serial(double* fvals, double* x, int N)`

  Approximates the integral of f using the trapezoidal rule.

* `double trapz_parallel(double* fvals, double* x, int N, int num_threads)`

  Approximates the integral of f using the trapezoidal rule in parallel. The
  number of threads to be used should be an argument to the function.

* `double simps_serial(double* fvals, double* x, int N)`

  Approximates the integral of f using Simpson's rule. Note that there are two
  cases to consider: the "nice" case when `N` is odd and the "not nice" case
  when `N` is even. Once you understand why there is an issue in the `N` is even
  case resolve the issue by taking a single trapezoidal rule approximation at
  the end of the data array to capture the "missing" part of the integral.
  
  (Hint: read the
  [`scipy.linalg.simps`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.integrate.simps.html#scipy.integrate.simps)
  documentation. In particular, read about the `even` keyword.)

* `double simps_parallel(double* fvals, double* x, int N, int num_threads)`

  Approximates the integral of f using the trapezoidal rule in parallel. The
  number of threads to be used should be an argument to the function.

* `double simps_parallel_chunked(double* fvals, double* x, int N, int num_threads, int chunk_size)`

  Approximates the integral of f using the trapezoidal rule in parallel. The
  number of threads to be used should be an argument to the function. In this
  implemenation you should use a `#pragma omp for` construct so you can pass in
  a chunk size to the loop thread scheduler. (Or write one manually. See Lecture
  11 and 12.)
  
  You do not need to use `#pragma omp for` in your implementation of
  `simps_parallel` but you may if you want to.

### 1) Tests - 60%

Your implementations will be run through the following test suite. Tests will
use an `x` where distance between subsequent points, `x[i+1]-x[i]`, is not
necessarily uniform. In particular, tests will be run on domains that look
something like:

``` python
x = numpy.append(linspace(-1,0,8,endpoint=False), linspace(0,3,127))
```

See
[Issue #7](https://github.com/uwhpsc-2016/homework3/issues/7#issuecomment-218065663)
for details on why we use domains of this form. In short, each Simpson's
subinterval needs the same `dx`. However, different Simpson's rule subintervals
are allowed to have different `dx.`


`trapz` Tests:

* (1pt) Check the definition of `trapz_serial` using data arrays of length two.
* (1pt) Test if `trapz_serial` matches (up to close to machine precision) the
  output of `scipy.integrate.trapz` for various `N`.
* (1pt) Check the definition of `trapz_parallel` using data arrays of length
  two.
* (1pt) Test if `trapz_parallel` matches (up to close to machine precision) the
  output of `scipy.integrate.trapz` for various `N`.

  three.
* (1pt) Test if `simps_serial` matches (up to close to machine precision) the
  output of `scipy.integrate.simps` for various `N` **odd**. (This is the "nice"
  case.)
* (1pt) Test if `simps_serial` matches (up to close to machine precision) the
  output of `scipy.integrate.simps` for various `N` **even**. (This is the "not
  nice" case where an extra trapezoidal rule approximation needs to be done at
  the end of the data. See the
  [`scipy.linalg.simps`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.integrate.simps.html#scipy.integrate.simps)
  documentation.)
* (1pt) Check the definition of `simps_parallel` using data arrays of length
  three.
* (1pt) Test if `simps_parallel` matches (up to close to machine precision) the
  output of `scipy.integrate.simps` for various `N` **odd**.
* (1pt) Test if `simps_parallel` matches (up to close to machine precision) the
  output of `scipy.integrate.simps` for various `N` **even**.

Chunked `simps` Tests:

* (1pt) Check the definition of `simps_parallel_chunked` using data arrays of
  length three.
* (2pt) Test if `simps_parallel_chunked` matches (up to close to machine
  precision) the output of `scipy.integrate.simps` for various `N` **odd** and
  various values of `chunk_size`.
* (2pt) Test if `simps_parallel_chunked` matches (up to close to machine
  precision) the output of `scipy.integrate.simps` for various `N` **even** and
  various values of `chunk_size`.
  
**Total:** (15 / 15pts)
  
Note that in this homework assignment we will manually verify that the
`parallel` versions of your algorithms indeed implement some sort of parallel
structure. You will recieve zero points on the `parallel` tests if you only
implement the serial version of the code.


### 2) Report - 20%

Produce a PDF document named `report.pdf` in the directory `report` of the
repository. Please write your name and UW NetID (e.g. "cswiercz", not your
student ID number) at the top of the document. The report should contain
responses to the following questions:

* (12/20) Create a plot of parallel loop chunk sizes vs. corresponding runtime
  using chunked parallel Simpson's method. In particular, create a
  [`semilogx`](http://matplotlib.org/examples/pylab_examples/log_demo.html) plot
  of timings of `simps_parallel_chunked` with chunk size on horizontal axis and
  runtime on the vertical axis, using `homework3.time_simps_parallel_chunked`
  with the following data:
  
  ```
  N = 2**20
  x = numpy.linspace(-1,3,N)
  y = sin(exp(x))
  chunk_sizes = [2**0, 2**2, 2**4, 2**6, 2**8, ..., 2**20]
  ``` 
  
  * (2pt) In black, timings with `num_threads = 1`.
  * (2pt) In green, timings with `num_threads = 2`.
  * (2pt) In blue, timings with `num_threads = 4`.
  * (2pt) In red, timings `num_threads = 8`.
  * (2pt) Plot uses a logarithmic scale on the x-axis.
  * (1pt) Both x- and y-axes are labeled appropriately.
  * (1pt) Plot has a meaningful title.
  
  *Note that you may want to start with a smaller value of `N` while you're
  experimenting with getting the plot just right. Also, try generating several
  versions of the plot in case there is some system noise causing erradic timing
  behavior.*
  
* (8/20) Let's analyze this plot. In particular, provide comments on the
  following questions.
  
  * (2pt) What can be attributed to the `nthreads = 8` behavior when the
    `chunk_size` is small?
  * (2pt) What happens when the `chunk_size` is equal to the problem size (i.e.
    when `chunk_size = 2**20 = N`) and why does this affect the timings in the
    way that the plot suggests?
  * (2pt) Why is `chunk_size` relevant to this implementation of Simpson's rule
    as opposed to the simple example we did in class during
    [Lecture 12](https://mediasite6.pce.uw.edu/Mediasite/Play/838bac4ba16b45abbb369f52b6ef71701d?catalog=af5ab53f-571f-46e4-9747-bb5178a4e113)?
    (5 May, 2016?)
  * (2pt) What range of chunk values appear to be optimal for this particular
    value of `N` in parallel Simpson? Can you conjecture an ideal chunk value as
    a function of `N`. If so, why? If not, why not? *Note that this "optimal"
    chunk size may not be the same for non-Simpson's rule problems.*

### 3) Documentation - 10%

Provide documentation for the function prototypes listed in all of the files in
`include` following the formatting described in the
[Grading document](https://github.com/uwhpsc-2016/syllabus/blob/master/Grading.md).

### 4) Performance - 10%

We will time your implementation of the function `simps_parallel` via the
function `time_simps_parallel` with `num_threads = 4` for some value `N` between
`1e7` and `1e18`.

```
N = # approximately 2**7 and approximately 2**18
x = numpy.linspace(-1,3,N)
y = sin(exp(x))
```
